Dockarr Composarr
===
Why the weird name?
---
Decided in the tradition of apps like radarr, sonarr, and a multitude of others. This is a play on "docker-compose" => "docker-composer" => "dockarr-composarr"... Sorry!

Pronounced: Dock-ar Com-po-sar - talk like a pirate! 

Notes
---
Main branch is always stable.

Apps
---
TBD - see comment at the top of every docker-compose.yml file.
